        * including but not limited to exchange-traded securities. High-level concepts relevant to securities classification, 
        * identification, issuance, and registration of securities generally are covered, as well as additional detail for 
        * equities and debt instruments. More details defining derivatives, in particular, are covered in a separate 
        * derivatives domain area.
